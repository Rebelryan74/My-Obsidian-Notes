# Users and Groups in Command Line

Inside a linux system there are Users and Groups assigned to all files and directories.  A user can also be a part of a Group.  There can also be multiple Users within a group.

A User in a Group will have access to whatever access level is assigned to the Group.

`group` command will allow us to see if your user account is part of any groups

```ad-example
title: Ex group command
collapse: open
$ groups

ubuntu adm dialout cdrom floppy sudo audio dip video plugdev netdev


```

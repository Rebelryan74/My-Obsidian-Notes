# Root user in command line

The Root user in the command line is the Top-level user inside of the system.  They are essientially able to use any [[access level permissions]].  The only caveat is they can not execute any file, because files have to give the permission to be deleted.

### Analogy
It it not far streched to think of the Root user as like a God, because of its ultimate power that it has over the system.

There are Dangers of using the Root user though as with so much power could lead to drastic chages to computer system thats why it recommended to use the [[Sudo command in command line]]. 

It is highly likely that if you are using a manage server environment you will not be able to access the Root user, but if that is not the case the way you login is


```ad-note
title: login for root user
$ su -

Password:


```

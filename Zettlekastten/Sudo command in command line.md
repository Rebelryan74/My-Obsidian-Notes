# Sudo command in command line
The `sudo` command is a command that temporarily allows us to use to become the [[Root user in command line]].  

There are some benifits to doing this it adds a level of security to the system and also it tracks all the commands ran as the [[Root user in command line]] giving us a history of `sudo` commands ran.
